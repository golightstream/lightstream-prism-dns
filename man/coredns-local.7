.SH "NAME"
.PP
\fIlocal\fP - respond to local names.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fIlocal\fP will respond with a basic reply to a "local request". Local request are defined to be
names in the following zones: localhost, 0.in-addr.arpa, 127.in-addr.arpa and 255.in-addr.arpa \fIand\fP
any query asking for \fB\fClocalhost.<domain>\fR. When seeing the latter a metric counter is increased and
if \fIdebug\fP is enabled a debug log is emitted.

.PP
With \fIlocal\fP enabled any query falling under these zones will get a reply. The prevents the query
from "escaping" to the internet and putting strain on external infrastructure.

.PP
The zones are mostly empty, only \fB\fClocalhost.\fR address records (A and AAAA) are defined and a
\fB\fC1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.\fR reverse (PTR) record.

.SH "METRICS"
.PP
If monitoring is enabled (via the \fIprometheus\fP plugin) then the following metric is exported:

.IP \(bu 4
\fB\fCcoredns_local_localhost_requests_total{}\fR - a counter of the number of \fB\fClocalhost.<domain>\fR
requests CoreDNS has seen. Note this does \fInot\fP count \fB\fClocalhost.\fR queries.


.PP
Note that this metric \fIdoes not\fP have a \fB\fCserver\fR label, because it's more interesting to find the
client(s) performing these queries than to see which server handled it. You'll need to inspect the
debug log to get the client IP address.

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Only the \fB\fCin-addr.arpa.\fR reverse zone is implemented, \fB\fCip6.arpa.\fR queries are not intercepted.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
BIND9's configuration in Debian comes with these zones preconfigured. See the \fIdebug\fP plugin for
enabling debug logging.
